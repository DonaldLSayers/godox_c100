@ Preset mode on the see-through display, cycled with the center button.
@
@ The mode is the chosen preset (0..NPAL-1), or NPAL = rnd: a random preset
@ per photo/recording (lut_fill, photo_cave.s). It lives in byte 0xf1 of the
@ camera's settings (0x132160, 0xf4 bytes, checksummed and saved to NVRAM at
@ power-off when its dirty byte +0xa0 is 1; no firmware instruction uses
@ offsets 0xf1-0xf3), so it survives power-off; any other value counts as the
@ first preset. The display is an HT1621 segment panel (see
@ docs/c100-firmware.md); in photo and video mode its readouts are blank.
@ There, the three cells of the shutter-speed (SS) readout show the mode's
@ code: the preset's tag (BW as an 8 and a two-cell W) or "rnd".
@
@ lcd_hook: the periodic display refresh (FUN_00021318) draws the readouts
@ with 0x21180(flag), flag = 1 in the readout state (UI state 2), else 0. It
@ draws ISO (FUN_0001ff10) and F (FUN_00020afc), then tail-calls 0x20fd0 (the
@ video icon and SS) with r0 = flag at 0x21218, or, in the readout state with
@ SS blinking, at 0x21200. lcd_jump.s points the tail call at 0x21218 here.
@ In photo and video mode (r0 = 0, readouts blank) run the stock routine,
@ then write the code over the blank SS cells (HT1621 addresses 0x0d..0x13,
@ nothing else lives there) and return to the refresh's caller. With r0 != 0
@ (the readout state) just tail-call the stock routine.
@
@ center_hook: the center button's handler (FUN_0001dd6c,
@ ap_peripheral_F_key_exe, an ADC key) posts message 0x7041 once per press;
@ only the readout state acts on it (it cycles ISO/F/SS there; the arrows are
@ IO_ISO = 0x7042 and T = 0x7043, aspect -1/+1 in photo and video mode).
@ key_jump.s points that post (bl 0x42c at 0x1ddf8) here: in photo and video
@ mode, and not while recording, step the mode and mark the settings dirty
@ (so the firmware saves them at power-off); then post the message as before.
@ (v015 hooked the IO_ISO key's post at 0x1dd44 by mistake, going by the
@ handler's name: that is an arrow, and the mode never moved.)
@ The nibbles come from tools/palettes.py (LCD_TAG_DATA, one entry per mode).
